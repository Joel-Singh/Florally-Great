## Retrospective

First typescript project IIRC, I even initially started this in javascript. This project felt like it took me a lot longer than it should have to implement CRUD operations with a frontend to a Mongo database but eh, it was my first time doing such a thing. The types and interfaces are really messy in this project, with me not knowing how to properly manipulate types with typescript. I've also overabstracted in places, including in the aforementioned types, making things more complicated than they actually are. Looking at it another way, I've replicated the Java AbstractFactoryBuilder boilerplate memes in typescript lol.

My main takeaway is dealing with bad code, knowing to only touch already working code when its relevant to the currently in progress feature. Reining in the urge to refactor the whole damn thing, code doesn't rust after all. This arises from initially starting this in Javascript and coming back to it a better programmer after a long hiatus.
